# Simon Says Game

## Introduction
This repository contains a simple Simon Says game developed using raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Simon Says is a memory skill game that challenges players to follow an increasingly complex series of lights and sounds.

## Game Rules
In the game, players must remember and reproduce a sequence of lights and sounds that progressively gets longer and more complex with each round. The game starts with one color lighting up and gradually adds more to the sequence.
